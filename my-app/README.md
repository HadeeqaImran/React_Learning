# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Structure
node_modules/: This folder contains all the dependencies (libraries) installed using npm or yarn.

public/: This folder contains static assets like images and the main index.html file that serves as the entry point for the app.

src/: This folder contains the source code for your React app.

src/App.css: Global styles for the app.

src/App.js: The main application component.

src/App.test.js: Tests for the App component.

src/index.js: The entry point for the app, where the React app is rendered.

src/components/: A folder for reusable React components.

src/images/: A folder for static images.

src/index.css: Global styles for the app.

package.json: Contains metadata and dependencies for the project.

Here's a brief overview of the purpose of each file:

index.html: The main entry point for the app, served by the web server.

index.js: Renders the App component into the DOM.

App.js: The main application component, contains the app's layout and logic.

Components: Reusable React components for building the app's UI.

Styles: Global styles for the app (App.css, index.css).

Images: Static images used in the app.

Tests: Tests for the App component (App.test.js).
